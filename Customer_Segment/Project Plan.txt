1. Problem Definition:
Objective: Identify and classify customer segments based on transactional behavior and develop a predictive model to anticipate future purchases for new customers.

2. Data Exploration and Descriptive Statistics:
Explore the dataset structure.
Check for missing values, outliers, and feature distributions.
Analyze age and gender distributions.
Identify popular items and product categories.
Explore purchase amounts and review ratings.

3. Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values, outliers, and irrelevant columns.
Create new features or aggregates (e.g., total purchase amount, frequency).
Normalize or scale numerical features.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize the distribution of key features.
Explore correlations between features.
Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to identify customer segments.

5. Customer Segmentation:
Apply clustering techniques to segment customers based on transactional behavior.
Visualize and analyze the characteristics of each segment.

6. Feature Selection:
Choose relevant features for classification.
Encode categorical features.

7. Classification Models:
Select classification algorithms (e.g., RandomForest, SVM, Logistic Regression).
Split data into training and testing sets.

8. Model Training and Evaluation:
Train each classification model on the training set.
Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Choose the best-performing model.

9. Model Interpretation:
Interpret the trained model to understand feature importance.
Analyze why certain customers are classified into specific segments.

10. Visualization:
Visualize customer segments and classification results.
Create plots or dashboards to present insights.

11. Documentation:
Document the entire process, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Explain the significance of features and results obtained.

12. Predictive Modeling for Future Purchases:
Develop a predictive model to anticipate purchases by new customers in the following year.
Use historical data to train the model (considering features such as age, gender, item purchased, category, purchase amount, review rating).
Evaluate the model's performance and provide insights on influencing factors.

13. Recommendations:
Provide recommendations based on customer segments and predictive modeling results.
Identify potential areas for marketing strategies or product improvements.

14. Visualizations for Specific Analyses:
Create visualizations for age and gender distributions.
Visualize seasonal sales trends and preferred product characteristics.
Map geographical sales performance.
Visualize future purchase predictions.

15. Model Deployment and Monitoring:
Deploy the predictive model for anticipating future purchases.
Provide guidelines for using the model.
Monitor and update the model as needed for accuracy.

16. Predictive Modeling (Optional):
If the dataset is large and includes historical data, consider building predictive models to forecast future trends or customer behavior.
